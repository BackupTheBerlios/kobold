\section{Architecture Editor}

The Architecture Editor displays the architecture of the product,
or product line respectively, that is selected in the Role View. \par

Architectures are directed graphs that consist of nodes and edges. 
Nodes represent components, variants and files. Directed edges represent
any relationship between nodes.\par

The Architecture Editor offers you the following options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Creating a Core Asset
	\item Creating a variant
	\item Creating a component
	\item Creating a version
	\item Creating a meta node
	\item Deleting a core asset, component, variant or version
	\item Deleting a meta node
	\item Creating a dependency edge
	\item Creating an exclusion edge
	\item Deleting an edge
	\item Marking a component as "deprecated"
	\item Moving an item
	\item Changing the size of an item
	\item Filtering the Architecture View
	\item Creating a custom component
	\item Deleting a custom component
\end{itemize}
Look up the explanations in the "Tutorial" section.

\section{Role View}

The Role View shows the current projects that are checked out in your workspace 
(see \ref{roletree}).
A project can either be a product or a product line. You can navigate between the 
different projects by selecting them. The open tree in the Role View displays the
role of the current user in the project. You can also see the architecture and its 
elements.

When you right-click on a project, a context menu will open where you can choose 
between different actions (see \ref{rolekontext}).

\section{Workflow/Task View}

In the bottom of the window you can see the Workflow/Task View which displays all 
the messages and workflows for the current user (see \ref{workflow}).

Double-click on an entry and a 
separate dialog will be opened where you can read the details of that message or
workflow (see \ref{workflowdialog}).

When you right-click on a message, a context menu will open where you can choose 
between different actions (see \ref{workflowkontext}).

The Architecture Editor offers you the following additional options:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Writing a mail
	\item Answering a mail
	\item Suggesting a file for a Core Group
	\item Dealing with a Core Group suggestion
\end{itemize}

\section{Minimap}

The Minimap is on the left side beneath the Role View. It shows the whole architecture.
By clicking at one spot on the map, the Architecture Editor automatically centers on that
spot.
