\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Kobold Server}

To start the Kobold server within Eclipse just select 'Run...' in the
'Run' menu from
Eclipse and select the class
{\it kobold.server.SecureKoboldWebServer} with a numerical programm argument for
the port it should listen for connections. 
You've to enter only one VM argument which is needed to locate the {\it
server.properties} file and to suite your local requirements: \par

\begin{verbatim}
-Dkobold.server.configFile=/home/garbeam/eclipse/kobold.server/server.properties
\end{verbatim}

Make sure that your {\it \$CLASSPATH} environment contains all JARs
provided by\\
 {\it kobold.common/contrib} beside a Java2 JRE and the Sun
JSSE classes (included by Sun JDK 1.4).

\subsection{Kobold Client Feature Set}
To start the Kobold client feature set from within Eclipse (which is
currently the only way) just select 'Run...' in the 'Run' menu and
double-click 'Run-time Workbench'. A new configuration is created which you 
can name as you wish (see \ref{run}). 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}

   \caption{This is how your buildpath should look like}
\label{run}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par

Confirm with 'Run'.

A new Eclipse instance will open with the Kobold feature set enabled.


\subsection{Kobold Server Administration Tool}
To start the Kobold Server Administration Tool within Eclipse just select 'Run...' in the
'Run' menu from
Eclipse and select the class
{\it kobold.client.serveradmin.ServerAdministrationTool}.

You've to enter only one VM argument which is needed to locate the {\it
sat.properties} file and to suite your local requirements: \par

\begin{verbatim}
-Dkobold.sat.configFile=/home/garbeam/eclipse/kobold.client.serveradmin/sat.properties
\end{verbatim}

\section{Setting the Kobold preferences}
In the Kobold Client menu, select 'Window' and then 'Preferences'. The preferences
dialog opens (see \ref{pref}). Select 'Kobold' and enter the properties for the Kobold Client.
They resemble your SAT properties (see chapter 'Installation').

\section{Exporting through GXL}

Select the productline, product, component or variant you want to export. In the
context menu of the object select "export" (see \ref{archcontext}). A wizard opens (see \ref{export}) where you can choose
whether to create a jar-file of the selected source or not. You should then enter
the path and names of the gxl-file and the jar-file. Alternatively you can enter 
the data through the "save as" dialog. To start the export, press the finish button.
You are able to see the status of your export in the wizard which will close after
the export is finished. If you decide not to do the export, simply press the 
"cancel" button.

\section{Creating a Workflow}

Workflows are triggered by specific rules which you can find in the ruleset.drl file.
Here you can find some existing rules as an example. \par

A rule consists of the following parts:
\begin{itemize}
	\item name
	\item parameters
	\item conditions
	\item one consequence
\end{itemize}
Rules are a mixture of XML and Java.\par

This is what a sample rule looks like: \\

$<$rule name = "Name of the rule"$>$\\
\begin{quote}
$<$parameter identifier = "spy"$>$\\
\begin{quote}
$<$java:class$>$ kobold.common.data.RPCSpy $<$/java:class$>$\\
\end{quote}
$<$/parameter$>$\par
$<$java:condition$>$ spy.getMethodName().equals("login") $<$/java:condition$>$\par
$<$java:consequence$>$ System.out.println("Rule fired."); $<$/java:consequence$>$\\
\end{quote}
$<$/rule$>$\par


The rule will only be fired when its conditions are true. If there are several conditions,
all of the have to be true. Conditions and consequence are written in Java.\par

For your own rules, the rule's parameter will always be an RPCSpy object of the package
kobold.common.data. Such an object is created whenever an action is being executed by the server.
These are in detail (using their actual method names):
\begin{itemize}
	\item login
	\item logout
	\item addUser
	\item getAllUsers
	\item removeUser
	\item updateUserPassword
	\item updateUserFullName
	\item getProductlineNames
	\item getProductline
	\item updateProductline
	\item updateProduct
	\item updateComponent
	\item checkAdministrability
	\item newProductline
	\item invalidateProductline
	\item assignPle
	\item unassignPle
\end{itemize}
The parameter RPCSpy will contain the methodName which you can get with the "getMethodName()" method. 
This returns one of the above Strings. An RPCSpy object also contains a vector of
arguments that were transmitted to the server for the execution. You have access to this vector through
the "getArguments()" method. \par
In the last chapter you find the source code of the classes you need to work with for writing your own rules.
In order to have an up-to-date appendix, check out the complete Kobold module. 
Then enter following commands in the console within the directory of the user manual:

\begin{verbatim}
perl appendix.pl >appendix.tex
\end{verbatim}

After that, rebuild the usermanual.pdf.

\section{Filtering the Architecture View}

The toolbar of the Architecture Editor provides you with the following filterings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Show/hide dependency edges
	\item Show/hide exclusion edges
	\item Show/hide synthetical edges
	\item Show/hide deprecated components
\end{itemize}

\section{User-related}

\subsection{Creating a user}

Right-click on the product the new user shall belong to. In the context menu choose
"new" and then "user". A wizard opens where you can enter the username and the
initial password of the user (see \ref{createuser1}). 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{center}
\end{figure}\par

After you press "next", you are able to specify the role of the user in the current
project.

%TODO: Screenshot einfügen

Pressing "next" again finishes the process. The new user is created.

\subsection{Changing a user role}

Right-click on the corresponding product and choose "change role". A wizard opens.
On the left side you can see a list of all existing users. On 
the right side you can see lists of the product engineers and programmers that
belong to the product. You can switch users from left to right and back by selecting
the user and using
the "<<" and ">>" buttons between the lists. In order to find a specific user in
the left-hand list, enter the initial letters of the user. The list will then show
only those usernames that start with the same letters. Press "Ok" when you are done
and your changes are saved.

Enter the command "createpl". You are asked to enter the name of the new product
line. Once you confirmed your entry, the product line is created.

\subsection{Deleting a product line}
Enter the command "removepl". You are then asked to enter the name of the product
line you want to remove. Once you confirmed your entry, the product line is deleted.

\subsection{Upgrading an existing user to PLE status}
Enter the command "addple". You are asked to enter the name of the person you want
to upgrade as PLE. Finally, enter the name of the product line you want to assign
the new PLE to. Once you confirmed your entry, the user has PLE rights.

\subsection{Removing PLE rights}
Enter the command "removeple". You are asked to enter the name of the user who shall 
no longer have PLE rights. Also, enter the name of the product line you want to
remove the PLE from. Once you confirmed your entry, the user is no longer PLE of
the entered product line.

\subsection{Getting a list of all existing commands}
Enter the command "help" and you get a list of all the commands of this tool and
their meanings.

\subsection{Exiting the tool}
Enter the command "exit".
