\section{Preconditions}




\section{Creating a productline}
Enter the command 'newpl'. A listing is shown with the properties of the lately created
productline. You can change the properties as described above. By enetering 'p' the SAT
tries to create a new productline with the current settings. \par

Please not that every productline of a Kobold server must have an unique name. Creation
of a productline with an already assigned name will be refused by the server.



\section{Creating a new user}
Enter the command 'newuser'. A listing is shown with the properties of the lately created
user, his/her username, fullname and initial password. After enetering 'p' a new user with
the shown properties is created on the server.\par

Note that every registered user needs to have its own unique username. Creation of a new user 
with a username that's already been registered will be refused by the server.



\section{Assigning an existing user to a productline as PLE}
Enter the command 'assignple'. You are asked to enter the name of the person you want
to become PLE. Finally, enter the name of the productline you want to assign the new 
PLE to. Once you confirmed your entry, the user has PLE rights.
