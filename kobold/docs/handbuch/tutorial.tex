\section{Preconditions}
In order to perform this tutorial, install Kobold and start the Client, Server and
Server Administration Tool. Make sure that you have set the correct properties for your
Client. 


\section{Creating a productline}
In your SAT Tool, enter the command 'newpl'. A listing is shown with the properties of the lately created
productline. Enter the command '1' and then 'testproductline' as name for your
new productline. Enter the command 'p' to create the productline.

\section{Creating a new user}
In your SAT Tool, enter the command 'newuser'. A listing is shown with the properties of the lately created
user, his/her username, fullname and initial password. 
Enter the command '1' and then 'testuser' as username for your new user.
Enter the command 'p' to create the user.

\section{Assigning an existing user to a productline as PLE}
In your SAT Tool, enter the command 'assignple'. 
As PLE enter the username 'testuser'. As productline enter your productline 'testproductline'.

\section{Starting a new project}

Start the Client.
In the File menu select 'New' and then 'Kobold PLAM Project'. The Kobold wizard opens.
Enter the url of your Kobold server, your username (testuser) and a blank for your password. Then press
"test connection". If the test succeeds, the "next" button is enabled.

Press finish and your new project is created.


\section{Creating a Core Assets}

In the Architecture Tree (on the left) open up the tree of your new project. Double-click on 'architecture' in order to 
open the Architecture Editor. \par

Open the pallete on the right of the Architecture Editor and select the 'component' item. Click in 
the Architecture Editor. A core asset is inserted and a dialog opens where you enter 'componentA' as name of
the core asset.

\end{center}
\end{figure}\par

Repeat these steps another two times and create the core assets 'componentB' and
'componentC'. After this your architecture should look like the following:

   \caption{Your Core Assets}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par


\section{Creating variants}

In the pallete select the "variant" item. Click within componentA in 
the Architecture Editor. A variant is inserted and a dialog opens where you can enter 'variantA1' as name of
the variant. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{tutorial9.png}
   \caption{Asset Configuration Variant}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par

Repeat these steps another two times in order to create the variants 'variantA2' and 'variantB'.
After this your architecture should look like the following:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{tutorial10.png}
   \caption{Your Variants}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par


\section{Creating releases}

In the pallete select the "release" item. Click within variantA1 in 
the Architecture Editor. A release is inserted and a dialog opens where you can enter 'releaseA' as name of
the release. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{tutorial11.png}
   \caption{Asset Configuration Release}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par

Repeat these steps another two times in order to create the releases 'releaseB1' and 
'releaseB2'. After this your architecture should look like the following:

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=10cm]{tutorial12.png}
   \caption{Your Releases}
\end{center}
\end{figure}\par



\section{Creating dependency edges}

In the pallete select the "include edge" item. Select the assets 'variantA1', 'releaseB1', 
'componentA' and 'componentC' in this order. Two dependency edges appear between the
assets. After this your architecture should look like the following:
